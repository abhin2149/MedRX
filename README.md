# MedRX

Created a Mobile App for B2B reselling of leftover medicine to prevent wastage of expired medical resources. The app is built for chemists,  dispensaries, medical practioners etc. to facilitate buying, selling and exchange of medicines between them. This utilizes the medical resourses to the fullest without any wastage.

The app uses the Google Maps API and device GPS features to provide real time location. It also shows all the nearby users who are willing to buy or sell the medicines along with their expiry date. Firebase is used as the backend service to provide database features, file upload for license verification, notifications etc.


My Team won 3rd prize for the same in the Bhartiya Vidyapeeth COE HackTillEnd Hackathon sponsered by Intel (2018).
